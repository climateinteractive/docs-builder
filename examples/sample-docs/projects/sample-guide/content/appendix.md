# <!-- section:appendix -->:appendix__title:

This is the appendix.  The text is pink because of a project- and page-specific CSS override.

(This is an example of a page that is only in English and not made available for translation.)

The following chemical formulas should be subscripted automatically:
* CO2
* CF4
* CH4
* H2O
* N2O
* NF3
* O2
* O3
* SF6

Those formulas should not be subscripted when they appear in URLs, for example [CO2](https://www.climateinteractive.org/CO2).
